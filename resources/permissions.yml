# == MachinaCraft permissions.yml ==
# Convenience permission file for bukkit's permissions.yml.
#
# This file can be used on a server without a permissions mod to allow everyone
# on the server access to all basic machinacraft functionality.
#
# On servers that do use a permission setup, you can change the default option to:
# default: op
# and use the master machinacraft permission to easily control all machinacraft
# access via your permissions plugin.
#
# == How to use ==
# * If your permissions.yml file in your bukkit folder is empty, you can
#   replace it with this file.
# * Otherwise, add the contents below to your existing configuration to use the
#   machinacraft convenience permission.
# * To allow the pump to work with lava, uncomment the bottom line that reads:
#   machinapump.lava.all: true
