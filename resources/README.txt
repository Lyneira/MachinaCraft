== Installation ==
* Place MachinaCore.jar and the .jar files for the plugins you would like in
your server's plugin folder.
* Servers without permissions:
  Add the contents of permissions.yml to your server's permissions.yml to allow
  all players access.
* Servers with a permissions plugin:
  You can use the above step to conveniently control access to all basic
  machinacraft functionality via the 'machinacraft' permission. Then, either:
  * Be sure to set the default to 'op' in permissions.yml
  * Exclude the 'machinacraft' permission from players you don't want to have
    access.
