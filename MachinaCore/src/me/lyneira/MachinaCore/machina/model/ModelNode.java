 * Represents a part (or all) of the blocks of a machina. A machina can consist
 * of multiple nodes that form a tree structure. A node can be active in the
 * world or inactive (its blocks and all those under it are not present but they
 * would appear when activated).
 * <p>
 * 
 * Nodes have an offset (defaulting to 0,0,0) from their parent node, so that
 * different parts of a machina can move in relation to each other. If the
 * offset of a node changes, it will change the effective location of all the
 * blocks that fall under it, including those belonging to child nodes.
