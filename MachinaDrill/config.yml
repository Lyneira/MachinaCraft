#             20 ticks = 1 second.
# use-energy: Whether the drill needs fuel to run.
# active-limit: How many drills a player can have active at any one time. 0 means no limit.
# depth-limit: Prevents a horizontal drill from being activated if its anchor at a Y coordinate less than this. 0 means it can activate anywhere.
#   Example: A value of 20 would prevent players from mining with a drill at a depth where diamonds appear.
